Getting Started
Work with your partners to create a GitHub repository for this project. You should meet and outline a basic structure for the application.  Much of it will be unclear but try to determine the relationship among the classes.  I suggest that each of you take one of the classes above, open a branch, and begin some basic coding of that class.
