GROUP	Does the program compile completely and without error when you run "javac Connect4GUI" from within the source directory?	Does the program appear to run correctly when you run "java Connect4GUI 5"?  It should create a graphics window containing the board.	When your run "java Connect4GUI 5" does Connect4GUI permit you to place tokens in the columns you choose?	When your run "java Connect4GUI 5" does Connect4GUI permit you to place tokens until a winner (of any type) is reached?	When your run the program for board size 3, does the program work?	When your run the program for board size 8, does the program work?	Describe aspects of the program interface that you find appealing.	Describe aspects of the program interface that you think should be modified.  Try to provide concrete feedback!	Take a look at the MyCanvas.java.  Is it clear how tokens are added and how the program deals with a new token?  (provide a sentence or two, not just yes/no)	 Now take a look at Board.java  Is it clear how a winner is determined? (provide a sentence or two, not just yes/no)	Scan over the code and rate how well it is designed.  Consider variable and method names, structure, and indenting.	Scan over the code and rate how well it is commented.  Can you easily determine what complicated methods do and what instance variables represent?
2	4	Yes	Yes it permits placement of X and O to tokens.	Yes it permits placement of X and O to tokens and reports a winner correctly.	yes	yes	I like the slot-type of approach that the program has, instead of just circles top of the board.	Maybe adding a winning condition. The background looks pink in my computer, and It might be too bright for me, at least on my computer. Maybe implementing a keypressed override that stablished that when the key is being held it does not reprint all the information, since it occupates a lot of space in the console. Otherwise very nice job!	Yes, it creates a new token and then add it to the token arraylist.	Yes, if the slots are not "no winner" slots (Im guessing if they are empty), and the player in those cases is the same one as the first we are comparing, then it would return the winner	4	4
2	4	Yes	Yes it permits placement of X and O to tokens.	No, a winner is not reported in the case(s) I tried.	it does not work 	it does not work 	I like how clear it works and play the game when a player press the key and it shows the player and specify the place and its name. ( simple term the clarity in playing)	it does not detect the winner and it does not run the program for board size 3 or 8. 	yes, as it is using the add method and then coordinates its color and then using arraylist and store it there. and as the new token is added, it updates using repaint.	yes it is, but unfortunately it does not work in GUI (Game) here.  	4	4
